# ðŸŒ¿ AI-Driven Treatment Advisory System for Pomegranate Disease Diagnosis and Severity Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-powered, end-to-end AI system that classifies pomegranate fruit diseases, estimates severity, and generates severity-specific treatment recommendations using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- **99.35% Classification Accuracy** using DenseNet121 on a curated 5,099-image dataset covering 5 pomegranate disease categories.
- **Severity Estimation** using a novel **Healthy-Based Deviation Scoring (HBDS)** method combining:
  - Grad-CAM++ for lesion localization  
  - Mahalanobis Distance for feature deviation  
  - GMM for severity-level clustering (Low, Medium, High)
- **RAG-based Treatment Generator** using:
  - Qdrant vector database for semantic search  
  - Mistral Small 3.1 LLM for grounded response generation
- **Deployment-Ready Flask App**:
  - Image upload, prediction + severity visualization  
  - Chatbot interface for real-time queries  
  - Downloadable PDF treatment reports

ðŸ“Œ Future Work

Add multilingual support for regional Indian languages
Expand to other crops (mango, guava, citrus)
Deploy on cloud / edge (Raspberry Pi, Android)
